I hopped around different task managers so I decided to make my own so that I can customize it.

## Features
- Import Tasks
  - The code is written to seamlessly import from ClickUp as that's what I was migrating from but it also provides a default schema for imports.
- Month, Week, and Quarter Views
- Create, complete, prioritize, delete, comment on, and add subtasks to tasks.
- Drag and Drop interface for both Month and Week views
- Search tasks and goals
- Persistant database even in localhost using PouchDB 

## Future Plans
- Refactor to release app through Electron
- Google calendar integration
